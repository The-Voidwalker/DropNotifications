Ever been farming for something, only to find that it had already dropped and you had no idea?

Ever wanted for a notification to be generated in chat when a rare item drops?

Well, u/AnArousedKoalaaa did, so here we are.

This mod generates a chat notification whenever a rare item is dropped into the world. The notification is generated whenever the item drops, and it should not be generated if dropped by a player.

By default the following items will generate a notification:
* Coin Gun
* Discount Card
* Lucky Coin
* Slime Staff
* Corruption Key
* Crimson Key
* Frozen Key
* Hallowed Key
* Jungle Key
* Rod of Discord

Added Github support
